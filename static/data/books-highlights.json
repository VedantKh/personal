          "quote": "It would be banal to say that Apple wouldn’t be Apple today without China. There is no other place on earth that could have provided similar cost, efficiency, and scale. What this book contends is more intriguing—that China wouldn’t be China today without Apple. Its investments in the country have been spectacular, rivaling nation-building efforts in cost, man-hours, and impact. Apple itself estimates that since 2008 it has trained at least 28 million workers—more people than the entire labor force of California. China brilliantly played its long-term interests against Apple’s short-term needs. In 1999, none of Apple’s products were made in mainland China; by 2009, virtually all were. This rapid consolidation reflects a transfer of technology and know-how so consequential as to constitute a geopolitical event, like the fall of the Berlin Wall—but it’s an event that played out over many years, hidden by the twin threats of strict nondisclosure agreements and a censored media landscape where all the action was.\nInternal documents obtained for this book reveal that Apple’s investments in China reached $55 billion per year by 2015, an astronomical figure that doesn’t include the costs of components in Apple hardware—the so-called Bill of Materials, which would more than double the figure. Compare that to the CHIPS and Science Act, the flagship policy of the Biden administration that then–Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo called “a once-in-a-generation investment”—one that would “usher in a new era of American leadership in advanced semiconductor manufacturing.” The CHIPS and Science Act, which is designed to stimulate computer chip fabrication in America, will cost the US government $52 billion over four years—$3 billion shy of what Apple invested annually in China nearly a decade earlier. Let me underscore this point: Apple’s investments in China, every year for the past decade, are at least quadruple the amount the US commerce secretary considered a once-in-a-generation investment.",

          "quote": "The size and influence of Apple aren’t properly understood, in part because they are so difficult to fathom. How can it be, for instance, that demand from China’s 1.4 billion people indirectly supports, across all industries, between 1 million and 2.6 million jobs in America; whereas, by Tim Cook’s estimate, Apple alone supports 5 million jobs in China—3 million in manufacturing and another 1.8 million in app development? That upside-down contrast boggles the mind: one super-corporation has more of an impact on job creation in China than all of China has on America.",

That openness gave rise, in October 1979, to a breakthrough digital spreadsheet tool, VisiCalc, the first “killer app” for personal computers. Along with EasyWriter, an early word processor, VisiCalc helped transform the Apple II from a plaything to a workhorse.",

Speed and scale were the priorities, and they succeeded wildly. In the world of mainframes, IBM was known for making virtually everything itself. But the Boca Raton team took the opposite route and forced IBM’s other divisions to bid for contracts like any other supplier. The small crew outsourced just about everything, piecing together a computer from already-existing parts. And for the operating system, they found a tiny crew of geeks few people had heard of—a start-up in Albuquerque then calling itself Micro-Soft, led by twenty-five-year-old Bill Gates.",

          "quote": "Among those executives was Jean-Louis Gassée, who in 1986 started work on Apple’s first take-anywhere computer, a sixteen-pound beast called the Macintosh Portable. Gassée says the battery-powered computer was cutting-edge at the time, but Apple had so much difficulty assembling it in-house that it met repeated delays. By the time it was ready for the market in 1989, it had lost its edge. And Apple doomed its commercial chances by pricing it at $7,499.\nFrustrated by Apple’s in-house manufacturing deficiencies, Gassée advocated for the Portable’s laptop successor, the PowerBook, to be outsourced to contract manufacturers in Japan. This ignited a contentious debate in Cupertino, and Gassée, a Frenchman, was branded “anti-American.” But he won the debate, partially. Apple designed three PowerBooks—the 100, the 140 and the 160, in order of price—and had the 100 assembled in Japan. Sony canceled other projects to take on the challenge and freed up seven of its top engineers. Working from a half-page document of Apple specifications, Sony crammed the innards of a $4,500 Mac desktop into the form factor of a five-pound laptop. The whole project went from drawing board to production in just thirteen months, wowing Apple. It was priced at $2,300.",

The defeated Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island and established the Republic of China in exile, claiming sovereignty over both Taiwan and the mainland—a claim recognized by the United Nations until 1971. The island, once a backwater province of China, had modernized under fifty years of Japanese rule that ended with World War II. Then, with the United States acting as both a military shield and a significant importer, Taiwan experienced a postwar economic miracle. Its economy shifted away from agriculture and toward manufacturing and exports, first in low-tech electronics and textiles, and later in high-tech industries. Political reform followed. Taiwan had been under martial law since 1949, but the strict rules were lifted in 1987, giving way to wider liberalization and, in 1996, the island’s first democratic presidential elections.",

As the cost of making movies soared in the 1980s, in large part due to us, Universal hunkered down. Despite the runaway success of George Lucas’s Star Wars, the studio passed on Raiders of the Lost Ark when Tom Pollock, Lucas’s lawyer, demanded a fifty-fifty split. Paramount scooped it up on those terms and made a killing. Lew and Sid Sheinberg chose to ride out the bubble and pass on deals they deemed inflated. But the bubble lasted fifteen years. After Warner merged with Time Inc. and Sony bought Columbia, MCA began to look outmoded.",

You will want to gag at some of the stuff I’m going to talk about. Hold it in.”\n\t\t\tHirata was about five foot three, reserved but with a healthy sense of humor. For two hours we discussed golf, our children, Japanese art, stereo equipment, my Japanese bronze flower vase collection, baseball, and my love of everything Japanese. Then we had lunch and contemplated the glories of chocolate chip cookies. I passed out a sampling Judy had baked for the occasion. We resumed in the afternoon to ponder the novels of James Clavell and the films of Akira Kurosawa. We considered how Seven Samurai inspired The Magnificent Seven. We talked about Shotokan, or Japanese-style karate.\n\t\t\tIt was much the same that afternoon and the following two days. At dinner, which we took turns hosting, everyone changed into blue suits and ties. We toasted with scotch, sake, beer, and wine, and conversed about friendships and women. We avoided all reference as to why we were there. It was oblique, maddening, hilarious, tortuous, and absolutely necessary. It was on-the-job training in the Japanese way.",

He picked up a screenplay, leafed through it for an hour, laid it down, and had a glass of wine. He read a few more pages. Then he took a nap.\n\t\t\t“He’s a buyer,” Ron told me afterward, wistfully. “He does whatever he wants.

How it was time to strike out on his own, to be recognized as something more than my consigliere.\n\t\t\tI tried to sell him for two hours, as the knot in my stomach swelled into my throat. Finally, my voice faltered and I gave way. His mind was made up. I felt absolutely crushed. Ron was leaving, and taking the best, most human part of me with him. It felt like I was getting divorced.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t\tAfter I hung up, I tried to add up the mistakes I’d made with Ron over the years. One problem was money, our way of keeping score. Both Ron and Bill banked big slices of my corporate deals even though they’d had next to nothing to do with them. But knowing Ron’s feelings, I should have done more. I could have bought Bill out and passed Ron his equity. Or kept Bill and split everything in thirds. It might not have been fair, but it would have been worth it. Money was important to me, but not as important as Ron’s friendship.\n\t\t\tMy second error was even dumber, because it wouldn’t have cost a dime to fix. From the start, CAA was antihierarchical. We dispensed with the usual title pyramid and rotated the heads of our departments; I introduced everyone as my partner. For years my business card had just my name, no title. But once I started meeting with Fortune 50 CEOs, I needed formal standing, so in 1990, I became CAA’s chief executive officer. Ron was named president.\n\t\t\tI should have made Ron the CEO and called myself the chairman. Because he’d never brought the matter up, it never occurred to me what that kind of recognition might have meant to him. When I looked at my partner, I still saw the brash young man with the cojones to flirt with Geneviève Bujold. I saw the guy who hung out with the biggest stars in the world like he’d grown up with them. I had forgotten that Ron was a high school dropout who craved approval just as much as I did—maybe even more.\n\t\t\tThe biggest problem was that our friendship never quite recovered after I put him in handcuffs for his poker debts. I had instinctively moved to protect our company, rather than to protect Ron from himself. I don’t think I was wrong to do that. I do think I was wrong to behave, afterward, as if the crisis had never happened. It made it less scary for me. I should have taken Ron aside to talk to him about how he was doing, reestablished that unshakable bond, made it clear that I was with him through thick and thin. But men like me weren’t too good about opening up, about acknowledging our fears. And so his resentment festered.\n\t\t\tI didn’t want to be who I’d become, and Ron didn’t, either. But we were who we were. To this day Ron tells people, “I’m the best number two in the world.” And I have to hand it to him—he’s lasted as Universal’s number two for more than twenty years, through four different owners. I couldn’t have done that.\n\t\t\tAs I was about to learn in the most painful way possible, I suck at being number two.",

In 2009, Peter Thiel, who’d funded the data-analytics start-up Palantir with $200 million from his own funds, asked me to help his CEO, Alex Karp, expand the company from working solely with the federal government and law enforcement into the world of business. We narrowed the potential areas to attack to three: health (where insights on disease vulnerability or drug efficacy could be teased out of big data), advertising (which had grown increasingly focused on metrics), and finance. Alex and I, who became fast friends, chose finance because the sector had gotten crushed in 2008 and the banks were eager for new ideas. At the next Allen conference that summer, I introduced Alex to Jimmy Lee, a top investment banker at J.P. Morgan, which I knew had been unable to reliably price its underwater mortgages in the wake of the great recession.\n\t\t\tAlex blew Jimmy away and we made a deal with Morgan to launch a three-month pilot program. Alex and I worked with Alex’s cofounder, Stephen Cohen, and Stephen’s engineers, Nima Ghamsari and Rosco Hill. They customized one of the company’s algorithms so it would scrape thousands of hitherto uncorrelated data points about a given property and its location to determine a fair bid-ask spread. This allowed local branches to make speedy, accurate decisions. Settlements that used to take an average of twenty-seven days now got done in two. Jimmy Lee was overjoyed.",

I’d been slightly better at selling mutual funds, but I’d felt dead inside. So why was selling shoes so different? Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.",

One man, for instance, complained that Tiger flats didn’t have enough cushion. He wanted to run the Boston Marathon but didn’t think Tigers would last the twenty-six miles. So Johnson hired a local cobbler to graft rubber soles from a pair of shower shoes into a pair of Tiger flats. Voilà. Johnson’s Frankenstein flat had space-age, full-length, midsole cushioning. (Today it’s standard in all training shoes for runners.) The jerry-rigged Johnson sole was so dynamic, so soft, so new, Johnson’s customer posted a personal best in Boston. Johnson forwarded me the results and urged me to pass them along to Tiger. Bowerman had just asked me to do the same with his batch of notes a few weeks earlier. Good grief, I thought, one mad genius at a time.",

The trustees at the old investment institutions were compensated by the volume of assets under management rather than by a performance fee, and they reached decisions by committee. Jones’s method broke the mold. It was each stock picker for himself; it substituted individualism for collectivism and adrenaline for complacency.

It was not as though the institutional investors enjoyed the benefits of wonderfully efficient markets, only to have an evil hedge fund corrupt them. Rather, institutional investors faced lousy markets that were highly inefficient in the short run.

Under Cootner’s system, the firm’s trading capital sat in one big pot. The traders could dip into it freely, but the firm charged them penal interest rates on the money if they added to large and volatile positions. In theory, a trader had to be brimming with confidence to double up a bet in a turbulent market. But the corn blight proved that brimming confidence was alarmingly abundant in a company of strong egos, and the clerical staff was so far behind in tracking traders’ exposure that there was effectively no risk control of any nature. Now that Cootner’s system had proved defective and Cootner himself was gone, Weymar set about creating a practical replacement.\r",

The cheap capital would boost earnings, which would in turn reinforce the appearance of success, persuading other investors to buy into the trust at an even greater premium. The trick, Soros insisted, was to focus neither on the course of earnings nor on the psychology that drove investors’ appetite. Rather, Soros homed in on the feedback loop between the two, predicting that each would drive the other forward until the trusts were so completely overvalued that a crash was inevitable.

The more out of line the exchange rate got, the more the speculators would feel themselves confirmed, and the more the imbalance in trade would keep growing.

Soon the dealers were doing precisely what Jones expected them to do. Because they understood that gold had already rallied and silver was positioned to follow, the dealers didn’t want to be caught with depleted inventories; they immediately phoned the silver exchange with purchase orders to replace what they had sold to Jones some minutes earlier. When their phone calls reached the exchange, the dealers were in for a surprise: The traders who would usually have had silver futures to off-load had already sold out to Tudor. The traders, for their part, followed Jones’s script too. When the dealers called them with urgent buy orders, they assumed that the rumors of a supply disruption must have come true, and they rushed to buy back some of the contracts that they had sold to Jones earlier. Before very long, pandemonium broke out; the speculators and dealers whom Jones had left short were scrambling to protect themselves from spiking prices, driving those prices up further as they did so.

To meet the brokers’ margin calls, hedge funds had to liquidate holdings on a grand scale: If you are leveraged one hundred to one, and if your broker demands an extra $4 million in margin, you have to sell $400 million worth of bonds—quickly. As hedge funds liquidated bond positions, the selling pressure drove their remaining holdings down, triggering yet further margin calls from brokers.

For example, Long-Term might buy one Italian bond and short another one, betting that the gap between them would converge; by studying the history of this trade, it might discover that, on ninety-nine days out of a hundred, the worst that was likely to happen was that the gap would widen by ten basis points.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If the trade was sized such that a one-basis-point widening cost LTCM $10 million, the fund’s loss from a ten-basis-point move would be $100 million.",

Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.\n\n■ To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.\n\n■ Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you’ve built.\n\n■ Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.\n\nThere are three voice tones available to negotiators:\n\n1. The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.\n\n2. The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking.\n\n3. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.\n\n■ Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.",

Past attempts at any kind of debate created immediate pushback. “There’s a better way” was always interpreted by this boss as “the lazy way.”\n\nSuch a drive-by occurred toward the end of a long consulting engagement, one that had generated literally thousands of documents. The boss, still skeptical of anything “digital,” wanted the security of paper copies.\n\nPopping his head into her office, the boss said, “Let’s make two copies of all the paperwork.”\n\n“I’m sorry, two copies?” she mirrored in response, remembering not only the DJ voice, but to deliver the mirror in an inquisitive tone. The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.” Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. They will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first time. Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and you’re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying.\n\n“Yes,” her boss responded, “one for us and one for the customer.”\n\n“I’m sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for a copy and we need a copy for internal use?”\n\n“Actually, I’ll check with the client—they haven’t asked for anything. But I definitely want a copy. That’s just how I do business.”\n\n“Absolutely,” she responded. “Thanks for checking with the customer. Where would you like to store the in-house copy? There’s no more space in the file room here.”\n\n“It’s fine. You can store it anywhere,” he said, slightly perturbed now.\n\n“Anywhere?” she mirrored again, with calm concern. When another person’s tone of voice or body language is inconsistent with his words, a good mirror can be particularly useful.\n\nIn this case, it caused her boss to take a nice, long pause—something he did not often do. My student sat silent. “As a matter of fact, you can put them in my office,” he said, with more composure than he’d had the whole conversation. “I’ll get the new assistant to print it for me after the project is done. For now, just create two digital backups.”\n\nA day later her boss emailed and wrote simply, “The two digital backups will be fine.”\n\nNot long after, I received an ecstatic email from this student: “I was shocked! I love mirrors! A week of work avoided!”",

It seems like this flight is likely booked solid, but with what you said, maybe someone affected by the weather might miss this connection. Is there any possibility a seat will be open?”\n\nListen to that riff: Label, tactical empathy, label. And only then a request.\n\nAt this point, Wendy says nothing and begins typing on her computer. Ryan, who’s eager not to talk himself out of a possible deal, engages in some silence.

And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use.\n\n■ The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them into the open.\n\n■ Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other party will fill the silence.\n\n■ Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.\n\n■ List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.\n\n■ Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood.

It was a matter of professional pride.\n\nI advised him to start off by anchoring the conversation in the idea that he didn’t have the money, but to do so without saying “No” so as not to hit their pride head-on.\n\n“How am I supposed to do that?” he asked in the next call.\n\nThe kidnapper made another general threat against the aunt and again demanded the cash.\n\nThat’s when I had the nephew subtly question the kidnapper’s fairness.\n\n“I’m sorry,” the nephew responded, “but how are we supposed to pay if you’re going to hurt her?”\n\nThat brought up the aunt’s death, which was the thing the kidnappers most wanted to avoid. They needed to keep her unharmed if they hoped to get any money. They were commodity traders, after all.\n\nNotice that to this point the nephew hadn’t named a price. This game of attrition finally pushed the kidnappers to name a number first. Without prodding, they dropped to $50,000.\n\nNow that the kidnappers’ reality had been bent to a smaller number, my colleagues and I told the nephew to stand his ground.\n\n“How can I come up with that kind of money?” we told him to ask.\n\nAgain, the kidnapper dropped his demand, to $25,000.\n\nNow that we had him in our sights, we had the nephew make his first offer, an extreme low anchor of $3,000.\n\nThe line went silent and the nephew began to sweat profusely, but we told him to hold tight. This always happened at the moment the kidnapper’s economic reality got totally rearranged.\n\nWhen he spoke again, the kidnapper seemed shell-shocked. But he went on. His next offer was lower, $10,000. Then we had the nephew answer with a strange number that seemed to come from deep calculation of what his aunt’s life was worth: $4,751.\n\nHis new price? $7,500. In response, we had the cousin “spontaneously” say he’d throw in a new portable CD stereo and repeated the $4,751. The kidnappers, who didn’t really want the CD stereo felt there was no more money to be had, said yes.\n\nSix hours later, the family paid that sum and the aunt came back home safely.",

          "quote": "People get hung up on “How much?” But don’t deal with numbers in isolation. That leads to bargaining, a series of rigid positions defined by emotional views of fairness and pride. Negotiation is a more intricate and subtle dynamic than that.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to bend your counterpart’s reality to your point of view is by pivoting to nonmonetary terms. After you’ve anchored them high, you can make your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren’t important to you but could be important to them. Or if their offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you than them. Since this is sometimes difficult, what we often do is throw out examples to start the brainstorming process.\n\nNot long ago I did some training for the Memphis Bar Association. Normally, for the training they were looking for, I’d charge $25,000 a day. They came in with a much lower offer that I balked at. They then offered to do a cover story about me in their association magazine. For me to be on the cover of a magazine that went out to who knows how many of the country’s top lawyers was priceless advertising. (Plus my mom is really proud of it!)\n\nThey had to put something on the cover anyway, so it had zero cost to them and I gave them a steep discount on my fee. I constantly use that as an example in my negotiations now when I name a price. I want to stimulate my counterpart’s brainstorming to see what valuable nonmonetary gems they might have that are cheap to them but valuable to me.",

So I got each of them on the phone and hit them hard with an accusation audit.\n\n“I got a lousy proposition for you,” I said, and paused until each asked me to go on. “By the time we get off the phone, you’re going to think I’m a lousy businessman. You’re going to think I can’t budget or plan. You’re going to think Chris Voss is a big talker. His first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn’t know how to run an operation. And he might even have lied to me.”\n\nAnd then, once I’d anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion.\n\n“Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else,” I said.\n\nSuddenly, their call wasn’t about being cut from $2,000 to $500 but how not to lose $500 to some other guy.",

That is, by alluding to a range.\n\nWhat I mean is this: When confronted with naming your terms or price, counter by recalling a similar deal which establishes your “ballpark,” albeit the best possible ballpark you wish to be in. Instead of saying, “I’m worth $110,000,” Jerry might have said, “At top places like X Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.”\n\nThat gets your point across without moving the other party into a defensive position. And it gets him thinking at higher levels. Research shows that people who hear extreme anchors unconsciously adjust their expectations in the direction of the opening number. Many even go directly to their price limit. If Jerry had given this range, the firm probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so cheap next to $170,000.\n\nIn a recent study, Columbia Business School psychologists found that job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a “bolstering range,” in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted.\n\nUnderstand, if you offer a range (and it’s a good idea to do so) expect them to come in at the low end.",

Key techniques include active listening, mirroring (repeating the last few words spoken by the counterpart), and labeling (identifying and verbalizing the other party's emotions), all aimed at fostering collaboration and uncovering hidden information to achieve mutually beneficial agreements.

And China is trying to follow Singapore rather than the West when it comes to welfare as well as democracy: It has extended pension coverage to an additional 240 million rural people in the past two years, far more than the total number of people covered by America’s public-pension system, but it also plainly wants to avoid America’s excesses.",

(Hobbes wrote in his autobiography that “at that point my mother was filled with such fear that she bore twins, me and together with me fear.”5) His father was a poorly educated clergyman who occupied one of the poorest livings in Wiltshire, spent more time in the local alehouse than in his church, and was eventually obliged to “fly for it.”6 Elizabethan England was always under threat: Witness Philip II’s armada. And the paranoia, fanned by religious conflict, continued under James I: Witness the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. In 1640 the Stuarts’ autocratic but cash-strapped regime broke down. The resulting civil war between Charles I and his Puritan foes in Parliament ended in regicide and dictatorship and claimed the lives of a higher proportion of the British population than did the First World War.

Spencer was not just an uncompromising defender of the free market: He believed that any intervention in the market, even passing laws to prevent eight-year-olds from being sent up chimneys, would inevitably lead to socialism. He enlisted Charles Darwin in the free-market cause. He argued that the struggle for survival in nature (which he memorably described as being “red in tooth and claw”) was analogous to the struggle for survival in the economy: Social reform would inevitably lead to national degeneration because it would punish the respectable classes while rewarding the profligate poor and their hordes of ­children.\n\t\t\tGladstone too stuck to the cause: “We live at a time when there is a disposition to think that Government should do this and that, and that Government ought to do everything,” he warned in 1889.21 “If the Government takes into its hands that which the man ought to do for himself, it will inflict upon him greater mischiefs than all the benefits he will have received.” And that from one of Britain’s great social reformers.",

She curbed government spending, controlled the money supply and abolished exchange controls, all decisive breaks with postwar orthodoxies. She sold off council houses, creating the basis for working-class Thatcherism. She cut industrial subsidies, sending many firms to the wall. Against the background of a world recession, the result was a sharp rise in unemployment. By 1981, when unemployment passed three million, police were openly battling Molotov cocktail–throwing protesters on many city streets in Britain, and the Tory wets were lined up against her. Rather than ­retreating in the same way that Heath did, she doubled down: “You turn if you want to, the lady’s not for turning,” she famously said at the Tory Party conference in 1981. She was, in retrospect, immensely lucky—lucky that the British Left fractured and insisted on choosing unelectable leaders and lucky that Argentina’s General Galtieri decided to invade the Falkland Islands when he did, allowing her to wrest them back and then win an election in 1983.",

We have succeeded in stalling the progress of socialism, but we have not succeeded in reversing its course.”38 That verdict would arguably be even more depressing today, especially when you look not just at the size of government, but its power.

      "summary": "\"The Fourth Revolution\" by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge examines the evolution of the state through three major transformations: the nation-state, the liberal state, and the welfare state. The authors argue that we are now entering a fourth revolution, characterized by a global race to reinvent government structures in response to modern challenges. They highlight how emerging nations, particularly in Asia, are pioneering innovative governance models that blend state-directed capitalism with authoritarian modernization, potentially outpacing Western democracies.

Anders, however, wanted to align managers with shareholders, and developed a compensation plan that rewarded managers for sustained improvements in stock price.\r\nThe problem with this plan was that almost immediately after its implementation, the stock price moved quickly upward as Wall Street began to understand the effect of Anders’s unusual moves, resulting in very early and large bonus payments to management. These payments were immediately seized on by the press and became highly controversial.

          "quote": "This is one of the most important keys to your success, and I can’t emphasize it enough: Listen to your users/customers and, particularly during the product-market fit phase, try to understand what doesn’t work for them. This user feedback is the only thing that allows you to move faster, and it is the only thing that matters. Even though we could glean pretty good measurements out of our system, if you don’t speak with users, you can easily figure out the “what,” but not the “why.” And in order to get to “good enough,” you need to understand the “why.”\nThis is exactly what we did. When we realized things weren’t working, we immediately went out and spoke with drivers. They told us what didn’t work, so the next version was all about fixing those issues. Each time we just knew, with 100 percent conviction, that this was it, that this version was going to make the leapfrog … and then it didn’t. So, it was back to the next process of listening to the drivers and going into another iteration, again with the same conviction and determination … and then all over again.\nObviously, if we had known which one of the changes would compel the metaphorical frog to leap to the next level, we would have made those changes right at the beginning. But we didn’t know. Every time we thought we knew, it turned out we didn’t. Over time, the system improved, new drivers signed up, and the system became better and better. After a long journey of failures, through iteration after iteration, Waze finally took off.\nThe key takeaway: Building a start-up is a “journey of failures.” You try one approach—be it a new product feature or testing your pricing model or a decision about scaling up in a new territory—it fails, and you move on to the next idea until you get it right. And then you don’t change at all.",

I gave him the Yahoo email, and this guy just looked at me and said, “I know only two people that are still using Yahoo email, you … and my grandmother.”\nGoogle disrupted Yahoo on the email side, as well.

That was a challenging interaction: Our business model was to sell map and traffic data, and here was a real customer ready to pay a lot of money for exactly that.\nThe logistics firm was persistent. They suggested a ten-times-higher annual subscription price, and we still said no.\nThen they came up with an intriguing offer.\n“If you can create a sales-agent travel algorithm [a part of the program that deals with routes that have multiple stops, in case a salesperson needs to visit twenty different places in a day], we will make that double.”\nIt was a million dollars a year and, since Israel is rather small, we realized that we could actually do that—we could map by ourselves all the overpass and underpass clearances and get the no-truck restrictions from other sources. The sales-agent algorithm looked like something that we could do on a small scale (with a maximum of twenty stops per day).\nWe called for a management meeting and asked ourselves, “Should we?”\nOne voice said, “It is not a big issue to develop, and it is one million dollars per year.”\nBut another voice said, “Our mission is to help commuters avoid traffic jams, and therefore we should remain focused on solving the problem for the commuters. Right now, we are in the phase of becoming global and not making money.”\nThere were a few days of arguments, saying things like, “Wait a minute, this is only one trucking company, there are four million truckers in the US and, if they all pay one hundred to two hundred dollars a year, this is a big business.”\nThe argument back: “If we change either the value proposition or the target audience, then this is a new company or a pivot, which basically means we no longer believe in the problem we are trying to solve.”\nWe ended up saying no—no to truckers, no to bike riders, no to pedestrians, no to public transportation, no to anything that wasn’t commuters. The one-million-dollar-a-year deal that we could have in 2009 was higher than the revenues of Waze in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and was about the same order of magnitude of revenues we made in 2012 and 2013.\nOver the years I have told this story to people, and I am always asked, “Why not both?” And the answer is very simple: focus.\nA start-up, in order to be successful, needs to do one and only one thing right, and to increase the likelihood of doing so, it needs to say no to everything else. Focus is not only about what we are doing; it is about what we are not doing! These are the hard decisions to say no to.\nThe main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.",

Users are much more willing to register, for example, after they see the value and hopefully understand why registration is needed.\n2.Simplify it. Let’s say registration requires four steps. You can either have all of the steps appear on a single page or have a progress bar, but having four screens without a progress bar means that the user faces the unknown until they are done. And there is nothing like uncertainty to push users away.\n3.Copy (and microcopy). “Better” frequently is “fewer.” If you think because you have seven pages of guidelines therefore users should understand, let me ask you the following: When you get a new version of a product, and there are seven swipes you need to do in order to continue, what do you do? I will tell you what most people are doing: If this product is mandatory for you, simply swipe swiftly seven times without reading a word. If, however, you are a new user and this is your first time using the app, and it is not a mandatory app, most likely you will give up.\n4.Make use of visual language. This point has a lesser impact but is still very important. Product designers can influence decisionmaking through interface design that directs the user. For instance, critical information and call-for-action buttons should be designed to emphasize the preferred action you want your users to take, such as registering or completing a purchase. If you have a yes and no button both in the same color, or the yes button is in green and the no button has no color at all, most users will choose yes. Choices of color, size of text, and placement of buttons are very valuable for increasing conversion and getting better results.",

      "summary": "In \"Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution,\" Uri Levine, co-founder of Waze and Moovit, emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding and addressing customer problems rather than becoming attached to specific solutions. Drawing from his experiences building billion-dollar companies, Levine provides practical advice on topics such as hiring, disrupting inefficient markets, securing funding, and achieving product-market fit. The book serves as a mentorship guide, encouraging entrepreneurs to focus on solving significant consumer issues to create impactful and successful businesses.

For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.\n",

So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.\nThis is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.\nThe mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).\nOne great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have any of the people who interrupt you.
