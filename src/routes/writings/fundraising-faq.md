<Toggle question="How much are you raising?">

In most cases, you should give the number that is your ideal amount. And if you have a meaningful amount closed, you can also mention that to drive FOMO. For example, if your ideal is $1.5M, say: "I'm raising $1.5M, and have already closed half of that".

</Toggle>
<Toggle question="You're raising at an $xx cap? How did you come up with that number?">

There are a few possible approaches. Usually this is an investor who feels like your cap is too high and wants you to justify it. The fact is, there is no logical basis for the valuations of early stage companies, so there isn't really a literal answer to this question. Nonetheless, investors ask it anyway.

Here are some possible good answers:

1. If you already have investors committed on that cap, say "Well, we've already raised $xx on that cap from investors including x, y and z."
2. You can basically repeat your main points. Something like, "Well, we think a $30M cap is justified because we have a stellar team, $30K / month in revenue, growing 25% / month and this is a $4B market." Did that answer the question? No, not really, but if delivered convincingly investors will nod and say something like "ok, sounds reasonable".
3. Explain it from a dilution standpoint. Something like "We need to raise $4M to hit our next milestone and we only want to sell max 10% of the company in this round, so we're raising at a $40M cap".

<Toggle question="Why are you only raising $xM? That seems like not enough to get you to your Series A, and it may not be a big enough round for a fund of our size.">

Many funds do have ownership targets in order to do seed rounds. But remember these are targets that the investors themselves have created — these targets are not formal rules they must follow. Often this is just a negotiating technique to help them get more ownership in your round. (Or sometimes, it's just an excuse to pass on an investment and blame it on the founder.) Typically if an investor feels like a deal is good, they will waive these targets, or will just outright make an offer that is for a bigger amount than you're raising (after which, you can choose whether or not you want to negotiate).

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Do you have any questions for us?">

During your first meeting or call with investors, you should take the time to ask 4 important questions and write down the answers in your investor spreadsheet. Don't be afraid to ask these questions - the investor is expecting you to ask these. Asking them will make you appear organized and deliberate.

What is your normal check size?
How does your investment process work? Can you make solo decisions to fund or do you need to go through an approval process?
How many investments do you make per year?
What is your fund size?

It's critical to ask these questions early in the process so you can determine if the investor is worth spending time with. You can also ask other questions that are more specific to your company, if you have any.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Who else has invested? What's the status on your round / fundraise?">

This is one of those answers where the delivery is more important than the content. If you already have closed investors as part of this round, you should name them proudly (emphasize their credibility if they are domain experts or notable funds), and you can say "We have already closed $x of the $y we are raising."

However, it's understandable if you are in a position where you haven't closed anything yet or fundraising isn't going well. In that case, remember that investors are going to be watching your body language and tone of voice to see if you sound like things are actually going well or if you're just saying that. An investor said that when he'd ask founders this, he'd look at their eyes to see if there was a flash of panic. In the situation where you no one else has invested yet, you can answer with something like: "We only just started fundraising a few days ago. I'm swamped with meetings and everyone's asking very smart questions," or "We're taking lots of meetings and working through them," or "I have final partner meetings with 3 firms next week". Of course, if you're farther along with your raise, you can say "We have half of the round filled and anticipate the rest to move quickly."

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Are you looking for (or do you have) a lead investor?">

A very large percentage of companies never have a "lead" investor for their seed round SAFE. As such, in most cases you should say "We are meeting with funds that could write larger checks but we're focused on closing our round with quality investors as quickly as possible so we can get back to work."

It's worthwhile to understand what investors mean when they ask this question. When companies raise money on priced rounds (i.e., Series A rounds), a lead has a specific, legal definition - the firm who negotiated the term sheet with you. In fundraising rounds raised on SAFEs, this original legal definition is lost, and there is no clear or agreed upon meaning of what a "lead" is.

Nonetheless, the term has persisted. When investors ask about a lead, they may be unfamiliar with SAFEs and asking about the original meaning it had in the world of priced rounds. Or they may be asking essentially, "is there a large firm that has committed to investing in this round?"

If an investor tells you "I want to invest in you, but I don't lead," translate that in your mind to "No, except yes if you turn out to be a hot deal."

While this is lame investor behavior, it's extremely common so don't get flustered. The best thing to do is to mark the investor down accordingly and keep fundraising. You might come back to those people after you have more than half of your round committed.

<Toggle question="What are your financial projections?">

If you're an early stage company (making less than $20K / mo) and aiming to raise about $2M, you generally don't need a financial model to fundraise. Companies that are further along and hard-tech/biotech companies that are looking for large seeds often need a more detailed model.

If you're an early stage company and an investor is asking for this, it may be an indicator that the investor isn't an experience seed-stage investor. Financial projections are standard stuff in later stage investing, and they may be used to seeing them. They may also just be trying to figure out if you have a plan to hit your next milestones.

So in most cases you can just say you don't have detailed projections you can share but you do have future milestones (like hitting $100k MRR and raising a Series A). Explain your thinking around when you think that could happen and what you think needs to happen along the way.

If you do want to put together financial projections, the standard protocol is something like:

- Make a monthly projection for the next roughly 12 months. That means a spreadsheet with one column per month.
- Break your expenses down into a few major categories: people, equipment, etc. Don't try to account for the small stuff.
- If you have multiple lines of revenue / potential revenue, break them out
- If you have costs of goods sold (marginal costs), break them out separately from your fixed costs
- No one expects them to be very accurate at this stage, but having a model is still helpful to discuss what the future could look like

<Toggle question="Who are your previous investors?">

Once investors have invested in your company, you should broadcast their names to everyone you talk to - they are your social proof.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Who else (what other investors) are you talking to?">

Don't share. That's important to keep secret. Investors you are just "talking to" should never be mentioned - not until they commit. Otherwise, they are likely to reach out to each other and start influencing each other in ways you cannot control.

Say something like "We've been talking to some folks we're really excited about, and we'll share more when things are finalized."

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Can I see your cap table?">

If you've already met with the investor, they are high quality and/or writing a bigger size check, and you think they are very interested in investing, feel free to share your cap table. What do investors mean exactly by your "cap table"? Typically this is a spreadsheet where one tab has your share numbers (i.e., how many shares and what % of the company each founder owns ) and a separate tab with safe information. If you are using Pulley or Carta there are downloadable versions that can be used.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What are you looking for in a partner?">

The investor is asking what kind of help you want from your investor(s) outside of just money. Keep in mind that if you say something like "We're looking for deep expertise in our domain" and the investor doesn't have that, they may disqualify themselves as a good fit based on your answer. Think about what you want from your investors (that you think is reasonable) – your answer may change depending on who you're talking with (an angel, a fund, etc)... If this is your first time fundraising, you can also ask other founders who have raised before what their investors helped them with, for inspiration.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What is your market size?">

Read through the User Manual article about this here, and even consider creating a slide (whether in your main deck or in your appendix) about this. Some founders also like to have two versions of their market size: one for the market they're going after today, and one for the market that they could expand to in the 5-10 year horizon. Talk to your Group Partners about what is best for your situation.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="How do you think about defensibility / why can't your competitors copy this?">

This question is one of the more popular ones investors like to ask – especially in hot domains (like AI in 2023, etc). Sometimes, the answer may relate to you talking about a "moat" (see next question), whereas other times, it could relate to a difference in technology approach or market approach. Do your homework to really think through this question – and be prepared for them to ask about both the big players (FAANG companies, for example) and the smaller ones (other startups with similar ideas). And remember that confidence is key in your answer.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What's your moat?">

First, let's explain what a moat is. From Investopedia: "The term "economic moat," popularized by Warren Buffett, refers to a business's ability to maintain competitive advantages over its competitors in order to protect its long-term profits and market share. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders." In short: the investor is just trying to find out if you have some kind of plan for building up a strength that others cannot easily copy. Keep in mind that most seed companies likely don't have a moat built around their business quite yet (it's just too early). But you can certainly speak to how you think about creating a moat in the future. Moats can happen in various different ways: maybe your product is extremely sticky, or you have network effects among customers, or maybe there is an ecosystem effect, and so on.

This question is one of the more popular ones investors like to ask – especially in hot domains (like AI in 2023, etc). Sometimes, the answer may relate to you talking about a "moat" (see next question), whereas other times, it could relate to a difference in technology approach or market approach. Do your homework to really think through this question – and be prepared for them to ask about both the big players (FAANG companies, for example) and the smaller ones (other startups with similar ideas). And remember that confidence is key in your answer.

<Toggle question="What questions should I have asked you that I didn't?">

This is often a good opportunity to reiterate / go deeper into your strongest points – especially if you didn't get through all slides during your pitch.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="How are you different than [competitor name]?">

You should know all about all of your competitors, including those that are tangentially related. It's a red flag when you show up without that research done. That being said, when giving your answer, don't come off as naive – if you just bad-talk everyone else and act as if you're perfect, it won't come off well either. Show self awareness and differentiation when answering this question.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Tell me about your competitive landscape.">

The investor wants to learn more about who you see as competitors – we recommend you think about them from a high-level perspective. For example, you can bucket them into a few categories. Some founders like to have an appendix slide about this, while other founders like to just verbally explain the landscape. You should do whatever you think is best for your talk track / business, but be prepared to also talk about differentiation (see the point above) if asked more about a specific competitor.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What's your GTM strategy?">

Your GTM strategy (or, "go to market" strategy) is how you plan to get more customers / users. For your short-term GTM, you should share a high-level answer that sounds realistic, and ideally, one where you can show you've had some success already (whether it be founder-led sales, or something else). In the longer-term, you can be a bit more vague at first, as your strategy will likely change over time – and any smart investor should know that.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="How are you thinking about spending the money you raise (and how this will affect your burn)? How long will it last you? What hires are you planning to make first?">

Almost no seed company knows exactly how they will spend their money or who they will hire, so it's okay to push back and share how you're broadly thinking about this question (see [this](https://www.notion.so/Fundraising-guide-0970dbe56d70400da8d65a9ea57180ff?pvs=21) above, as well). But especially for seed companies, the key is ensuring the investor knows and is comfortable with you being flexible – after all, if you're hitting all of your goals much sooner than expected, you'll likely ramp up hiring sooner than expected, as well.

Investors may be asking you this question to find out if you're trying to sell soon / for a quick return, or if you're trying to "go big" (IPO or build a multi-billion dollar business, etc). They also could be asking this question if they have concerns about the exit opportunities in the market (for example, maybe there are few acquirers or paths to exit available in their eyes.)

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="Why are you a solo founder?">

Be confident in your answer, and share either what your rationale is, or whether you are open to finding a co-founder and what your steps in doing that are (along with assuring them that you are taking the process seriously and not making hasty decisions). Just remember when crafting your answer: you want to avoid them feeling like they need to wait for you to find a co-founder in order to invest, so be sure to have the investor feel confident enough in your skillset and abilities to continue running the company solo, at least for the time-being.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What are the biggest challenges you expect to have in the future? What would be a reason you may not succeed in building a billion $ business? If you fail, what will be the main reason?">

Investors want to make sure you are self aware about the long-term risks to your business. Every successful business has challenges, and investors know it, so be confident! It's key that you show self awareness (the equivalent of not answering "I work too hard" in a job interview) but also that you confidently share how you think about one day tackling or circumventing this challenge in the long-term.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What keeps you up at night?">

The investor is asking you what is the biggest thing (issue, problem, or challenge) on your mind right now. Especially as a CEO, your answer should show that you have a strong understanding of your business and are spending your time focused on the right things. Again, be honest but confident.

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What's your short term product roadmap look like, and what does the product look like 5-10 years from now?">

This question is asking exactly what it sounds like – have a few examples of what is on your short-term product, and really emphasize what the reason for each of those features or products is. In the long term, they want to know what the vision for the business is – what does this turn into, if you're incredibly successful?

</Toggle>

<Toggle question="What is the top reason customers say no to buying your product?">

The investor wants to make sure you're self aware enough to know the real rationale behind why some customers haven't bought your product. Just saying "price" is usually not a great indication of this. Be honest, but also share if you have a plan for how you will tackle the objection you've heard most frequently – unless you're okay with losing those customers (which often at early stages, businesses are), in which case it's great to confidently share that.
