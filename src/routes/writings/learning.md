‚ÄúI‚Äôm optimizing for learning.‚Äù A lot of young ambitious people say this, and quite a few of them mean it. But that doesn‚Äôt make your next steps obvious. 

If you‚Äôre looking to learn quickly but aren‚Äôt opinionated yet on what you want to work on, two things are generally good to optimise for. 
1. Quality people
2. Growth

Quality of people can be broken down into two dimensions: 
1. You are thoughtful about why you do what you do.
2. You bias towards action.

These people usually enact change. This is probably because there are a lot of issues in the world and they want to nudge the future into a path they prefer. Although my guess is even in a world without serious problems, these people would still be drawn to enacting change. Regardless, they are stifled by places that don't let them make change.

As a result, they usually end up in places that enable change, or create those places for themselves. This can be within art, research, sports, finance, or business. Since I'm in the Bay, I've been exposed mostly to the subset of the people trying to enact change through software. 

The only difference between a startup and a company is the potential for growth. PG has a great essay on this. 
Growth is painful. It‚Äôs messy. There are a hundred problems to figure out, and a surprisingly high proportion of those problems are people problems, not tech problems. You are usually playing a game of synthesis. Which cases of precedent can I synthesize to come up with a solution to my specific problem? Great artists steal, and similar to art, this synthesis requires and builds creativity. But due to the pace of challenges thrown at you, this process can be painful. This pain is like ùù≤ radiation. For most people, it‚Äôs not healthy, but for a few mutants, they can absorb it and turn into superheroes.
To make sure this ùù≤ radiation is given to you in the right doses, you need the right people around you. People who push you when you need it (leading by example by absorbing their own share of radiation) but also support you through the pain to increase the chances you show up for another day. This requires a level of shared vulnerability and mutual trust. Sometimes, you can find these people organically and build upon each other‚Äôs shower thoughts to find and iterate upon direction. If you‚Äôre the right people, you can survive the radiation long enough to start reaping the rewards: I.e. level 3. See the PMF game by Posthog. Then you start translating personal growth into economic growth. 
Sometimes you find a pool of people who can help dose you with and support you through the gamma radiation. Jump in. It‚Äôs hard to find these people, but follow your gut and have a high bar and it happens. Great companies create a lineage of other great companies, we‚Äôve seen this time and again. I‚Äôve curated a list of companies who I personally believe have 1. Great quality people, and 2. Have a lot of growth. They are likely to create their own lineage. So if you‚Äôre looking for direction and want concrete next steps, these could be a good starting point. 

Here is a list of companies I think highly of. Talent density, problem space, and growth opportunity are the biggest dimensions.
