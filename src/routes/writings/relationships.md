Data is king when training models. Architectural choices are made so that they successfully scale with data. High quality low volume data trumps high volume low quality, data. 

Similarly, relationships will be king when building companies. Good company decisions will be directionally aligned with improving these relationships. Think hiring, distribution, fundraising. 

This has always been true to some extent, but will become far more important this decade as models get better at cognitive tasks.
