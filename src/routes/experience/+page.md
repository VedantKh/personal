I was cofounder and CEO of Hazel. Raised $2M when I was 19, and hired
3 friends to build an entirely voice-first CRM for real estate agents
to use on the go.

Here's a [demo.](https://youtu.be/CKjFMmc5wi8?si=sfs4W27oi-hlZ9Yt&t=14)

Did hundreds of sales calls with 50 year old realtors in states like
Arkansas, which definitively popped my tech bubble. Thought
axiomatically about new UIs unlocked by LLMs, pricing models for
enterprise, and finding PMF.

Learned the hard way that SaaS isn't venture scale in residential real
estate, a better way to capture value is by building a brokerage and
automating the backend tasks. Decided I didn't want to start a
brokerage at 20, so retreated to the comfort of a Math major at
Stanford.

Internalized that the pain of entrepreneurship is only worth it for
the right problems.

#### Highlights

> When the SVP at Berkshire Hathaway's real estate
> brokerage in Silicon Valley loved our product so much he
> became an angel investor. After months of pivot hell, this felt good.

> A conversation with my cofounder Mason on a rooftop at 2 am, thinking
> about what we want to do with our lives.



# Friends and Family
Built an underground community of builders at Stanford and raised $200k to give out in grants. Here are my [thoughts](https://friendsandfam.xyz/builder-fellowships) about why this is important.

#### Highlights

> Moving people away from quant and towards building.



# Martian
Spent a few weeks at Martian on growth and product. Helped close a [channel partnership](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2024/accenture-invests-in-martian-to-bring-dynamic-routing-of-large-language-queries-and-more-effective-ai-systems-to-clients) with Accenture.

#### Highlights

> Meeting Ben, who became one of my best friends and changed the way I think.
